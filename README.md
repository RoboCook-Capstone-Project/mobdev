# Robocook
RoboCook was inspired by the common struggles that students face when living away from home. Our team recognizes that students often find themselves in a situation where they have limited groceries but lack the inspiration to create diverse and satisfying meals. Most of the time, they end up cooking the same meals repeatedly, which can get boring and affect their health. Besides, choosing what to eat can be overwhelming because there are so many options.

We aim to make cooking more fun and creative for the users with our RoboCook app. This app will use artificial intelligence to suggest interesting and diverse recipes based on what ingredients students have. The goal is to make cooking more enjoyable and encourage healthier eating.
